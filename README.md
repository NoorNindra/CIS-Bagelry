# CIS-Bagelry
CIS 18A Project - Bagelry


Project Description: 
My business is called Brilliant Bagelry! It is a shop with a variety of bagels and cream cheese. My program will allow the customer to choose their choice of bagel and cream cheese, view the cost, add a tip if wanted, and give the receipt. 

Purpose:
The purpose of my business is to make society happy and secure. The people will be happy with my product of choice and will feel secure that they have food for anytime they want! With my shop and how it is all set up online, my program will benefit the society because they will always have a place to go for breakfast. It will also reduce waiting times for the customers, it will be fast and quick. This will be efficient way for the employees as well as the customers. This will help tremendously with COVID since no shops will be open, it will reduce a crowd, and be very fast and safe! To serve my customers with quality food and love is my main purpose of my business and with my program I will be able to do that. My shop is usually open and we have the option of online, however because of COVID, we are doing things through online which my program will help in and customers will stay happy and satisfied. As long as my product is selling and thee customers are happy, the purpose will be fulfilled. As all of our bagels and homemade cream cheese is sold, our customers will stay satisfied and again our purpose will have been fulfilled.
